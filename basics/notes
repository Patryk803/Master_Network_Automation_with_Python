Upper case letters are used to declare a constant variable.

Python is dynamically typed and it means that the type is associated with run-time values, and not with named variables. Values stored
in variables have type and not the name or the variable itself. We can see what type of data a variable stores using the built-in type() funct.
The built-in id() function returns the memory address where the value referenced by the variable is stored. It basically returns the address
of the variable in memory

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. In Python tuples are written with round brackets.
Lists: Ordered mutable sequence of objects
Tuples: Ordered immutable sequence of objects
Dictionaries: Collections of unordered key:value pairs

a = 3.4
b= 2.3
If we a // b = 1.0 as
Python has two division operators, a single slash character for classic division and a double-slash for “floor” division
(rounds down to nearest whole number).

% - mod it's a remainder when doing division

round(18 / 13, 3) output would be 1.385 so it rounds to 3 digits after coma

Immutables variables ( so we cannot edit): integers, floats, strings, tuples, FrozedSets - if we change them, the id() changes
so we cannot actually change them

Mutable variables: lists, sets, dictionaries - if we .append something to the list the id() stays the same.
